    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        This application was created by a team of six Computer Science students at
        <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University</a> in partnership with the
        <a href="https://anthropoceneinstitute.com/">Anthropocene Institute</a> in spring 2022 for
        <a href="https://capstone.cse.msu.edu">CSE 498: Collaborative Design</a>, the capstone course within the
        <a href="https://reg.msu.edu/academicprograms/ProgramDetail.aspx?Program=2337">B.S. Computer Science and Engineering</a> degree program offered through the
        <a href="https://cse.msu.edu/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>.

        The Anthropocene Institute envisioned a
        <a href="http://www.capstone.cse.msu.edu/2022-01/projects/anthropocene-institute/">Wildfire Risks Forecasting Tool</a>
        to raise awareness, educate, and empower residents living in areas at risk of wildfires.
        The tool needed to be accessible, accurate, and actionable, allowing a user to simulate a hypothetical wildfire
        in their neighborhood while accounting for the potential effects of climate change on fire spread.
        Over the course of the Spring 2022 semester, this vision became a reality as six MSU Computer Science
        students explored potential use-cases, engineered a system architecture, and curated an aesthetic design.
        The final application offers an intuitive tool allowing users from Michigan to California to Japan to
        understand the risks posed by wildfire under climate change.

        As a nonprofit aiming to "connect entrepreneurs, investors, institutions, and thought leaders to solve our climate emergency,"
        the Anthropocene Institute supports transparent, open science. The source code supporting this application
        is availaible on <a href="https://github.com/andrewmcdonald27/CapstoneExploration">GitHub</a>.

        Our team would like to dedicate this project to Richard Chan, Director of the Anthropocene Institute, who passed away unexpectedly during the creation of the project.
        We are incredibly thankful to have had the opportunity to work with you, learn from you, and improve the world with you.
        May you rest in peace.
