EVC is mapped as continuous estimates of canopy cover for tree, shrub, and herbaceous lifeforms with a potential range from 10% to 100%. To translate continuous EVC values into fuel model assignments, EVC values are binned to correspond with the bins from previous LF versions. FVC leverages fuel transition assignments related to disturbed areas by re-establishing pre-disturbance vegetation. In 2019L FVC was developed using the latest Annual Disturbance products from the effective disturbance years of 2011 to 2019. Fuel products were created with LF 2016 Remap (LF Remap) vegetation in non-disturbed areas, but pre-disturbance vegetation was used in disturbed areas using fuel rule sets. More information about 2019L can be found at https://landfire.gov/lf_limited.php.2019L FVC is a capable fuels product that calculates time since disturbance (TSD) assignments for disturbed areas using an effective year. For example, year 2021 fuels may be calculated for the year 2019. This process considers all the existing disturbances and adjusts the TSD for these to the effective year (2021 in this example), making the products "2021 capable fuels." More information about capable fuels can be found at https://www.landfire.gov/lf_remap.php.</abstract>      <purpose>LF 2019L is the first update to the LF 2016 Remap conterminous United States (CONUS) extent. This update includes a limited set of products that represent circa 2019 ground conditions. Read more about LF 2019L here (https://landfire.gov/lf_limited.php).LF 2019L products are designed to facilitate national and regional level strategic fire and resource management planning and reporting of management activities. The principal purposes of the products include providing, 1) national level, landscape scale geospatial products to support fire and fuels management planning, and 2) consistent fuels products to support fire planning, analysis, and budgeting to evaluate fire management alternatives. Products are created at a 30 meter raster; however, the applicability of products varies by location and specific use. LF products were designed to support 1) national (all states) strategic planning, 2) regional (single large states or groups of smaller states), and 3) strategic/tactical planning for large sub regional landscapes and Fire Management Units (FMUs) (such as significant portions of states or multiple federal administrative entities). The applicability of LF products to support fire and land management planning on smaller areas will vary by product, location, and specific use. Managers and planners must evaluate LF products according to the scale and requirements specific to their needs.</purpose>      <supplinf>In LF 2019L, fuel products were created with LF 2016 Remap vegetation in non-disturbed areas, but pre-disturbance vegetation was used in disturbed areas.
